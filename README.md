# Brain-Tumor-Detection-System
This project is a Deep Learning–based Brain Tumor Detection System that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify MRI brain images as Tumor or No Tumor. A simple and clean Flask web application allows users to upload MRI images and instantly get prediction results.
